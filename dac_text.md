Problem: Given an integer n and a number x to guess in the range from 1 to n, the objective is to find the number x using as few tries as possible. On each attempt, a number is guessed and feedback is received indicating whether the guessed number is less than, greater than, or equal to the number x.

Input: Two integers, n and x (1 <= x <= n).
Output: The number of tries needed to guess the number x.
Now, let's compare the complexities of the two algorithms you have provided:

Iterative Algorithm: This algorithm uses a binary search approach to guess the number. At each step, it guesses the number in the middle of the current range and adjusts the range based on the feedback. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), since at each step it halves the size of the search range.


Recursive Algorithm: This algorithm also uses a binary search approach, but does so recursively. The time complexity is also O(log n) for the same reasons. However, this algorithm also has a space complexity of O(log n) due to the recursive call stack.


In summary, both algorithms have the same efficiency in terms of time complexity, but the recursive algorithm uses more space due to the stack of recursive calls. Therefore, if the range of numbers is very large, the iterative algorithm might be a better choice to avoid a stack overflow.
